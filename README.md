# Pagaxian

A work-in-progress refactoring to a gem of my personal ajax pagination and search pattern using DataTables and kaminari.

Currently has hard dependencies:
* Rais 3.1+
* kaminari (future: also will_paginate, mongoid-pagination)
* Mongoid (future: also ActiveRecord)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pagaxian'
